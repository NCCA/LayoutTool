# Layout Tool

This repository contains the tests / code and designs for a simply Gui Layout tool developed in the [Pipeline and Technical Direction Unit](https://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/msc/PipeLineAndTD/) on MSc Computer Animation and Visual Effects.

Whilst not intended to be a full tool, this project is designed to introduce key software / pipeline development techniques. 

1. Test Driven Development in Python
2. Python development tools (Black, MyPy)
3. Python GUI's using PyQt or PySide
4. Databases using sqlite
5. json reading and writing

Eventually we will also develop simple scripts to load the scene files generated into Maya and Houdini
